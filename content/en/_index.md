        Intelligent Remote-sensing Information Systems & Applications (IRIS)
        
        We work on computer vision and multi-source remote sensing to build end-to-end intelligent perception and application systems.
        From Earth to Eye: extending remote sensing beyond Earth observation with cross-disciplinary vision.

      subtitle: Research Themes
      text: |
        - **Remote Sensing Interpretation**: change detection, segmentation, multi-sensor fusion (optical/SAR).
        - **Computer Vision**: representation learning, generalization, multimodal understanding, reliable evaluation.
        - **Systems & Applications**: datasets/benchmarks, open-source toolchains, real-world impact and explainability.
